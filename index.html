          <p>As an Associate Data and Research Analyst at Columbia University in New York City, I bring a strong educational background and extensive experience working with large data sets.</p>
          <p>
            My passion for programming and data analytics began during my second to last year of college, while working in an accounting office and taking part-time classes at Baruch College. 
            I took a programming class focused on C++ and basic data structures, which ignited my love for coding. 
            I immediately changed my major from Finance to Computer Information Systems and immersed myself in the exciting world of programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Baruch, I gained a solid foundation in data structure and manipulation, utilizing Python Data Frames and libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
            I also honed my web scraping skills with BeautifulSoup and became skilled in SQL while working on various projects in different environments like MS Access, Oracle DBMS, and SQL Developer. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role at Columbia University, I continue to leverage my SQL expertise to extract and manipulate large amounts of data to create reports and datasets in response to often ad-hoc and time-sensitive requests from stakeholders.
            I am passionate about programming and data analytics and enjoy working with new technologies and applications to create more efficient and accurate data solutions. 
            My biggest strength lies in my ability to take on challenges and apply creativity to find optimal solutions.          

            <br/>
          </p>
            I am a highly analytical and detail-oriented data professional who loves to explore new ways of problem-solving. 
          I believe my skills and experience make me a great fit for any team looking to tackle complex data challenges and drive data-driven decision-making.

            My heart sings when I am outdoors, exploring new trails and immersing myself in nature. 
            Hiking, camping, and biking are my go-to activities that remind me of what is truly important in life and motivate me to be a better version of myself. 
            These experiences have taught me valuable lessons about endurance and perseverance, and I often draw from them in my daily life to overcome any challenges that come my way. <br />
            <p>
            Another one of my passions is traveling, which has taken me to South America, Asia, and Europe so far. 
              The process of discovery is what fuels my love for traveling; from new landscapes and cultures to meeting new people and gaining unique perspectives, there's nothing quite like stepping out of my comfort zone and exploring the unfamiliar. 
              This curiosity and appetite for more fuels my excitement to learn and expand my horizons. <br />
            <p>

            When I'm not adventuring, you can find me tending to my backyard garden in the heart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
              Growing delicious cucumbers, raspberries, and eggplants is both a tranquil escape and an ongoing project that keeps me grounded and connected to the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I believe in finding balance in life and pursuing what brings me joy, whether it's exploring the great outdoors, traveling to new places, or nurturing my garden. 
            These passions keep me energized and motivated, ready to take on any challenge that comes my way.
