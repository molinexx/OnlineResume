          <p>I am a 2020 graduate from Data Analytics Track at Baruch College in NYC and currently at working at Columbia College as Associate Data and research Analyst.</p>
          <p>
            I discovered my passion for programming during my second to the last year at college. A that time, I was working in accounting while taking part time classes in Baruch with my eyes set on finance degree until I decided to take programming class (C++, basic data structures with intro to object oriented programming). I absolutely fell in love with the magic of coding. 
            The same semester I changed my major to Computer Information Systems and decided to attend school full time to immerse myself into this new and exciting filed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have two full semesters experience working with Python 3x environment in Jupyter Notebook. I have solid understanding of basic data structures and data manipulation. During my school years I did a few projects using DataFrame,
            matplotlib and seaborn. Some of the data for my projects I obtained by web scraping using BeautifulSoup. 
            I am also proficient with SQL, and familiarwith with ELT/ETL processes, various SQL and NoSQL database management systems.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In my recent role as a Data and Research Analyst at Columbia University (CCIT) I further expanded my data base management skills while working in SQL environment (SSMS, SSRS, SSIS). 
            I have worked to create new and maintain existing packages ensuring all ETL processes are running smoothly and efficiently. 
            I created automated and interactive reports and countless data sets retrieving data from various data warehouses withing university systems. 
            And finally, I collate and analyze data to support data informed decision for variety of stakeholders. 
            <br/>
          </p>
            I am passionate about programming and data analitisc and very determined to make it my career. 
            I love learning new technologies, applications and creating new ways to provide more efficient and more accurate data solutions.  
            My biggest strength is being able to take a problem or challenge, analyze it and then apply creativity to find a perfect solution;  
            from all my past experiences I know that I am thriving on challenges.

            I am absolutely the happiest when I am outdoors:  hiking, camping, or biking. Being surrounded by nature centers me, reminds me of what is important in life, and motivates me to be a better person.
            Hiking is challenging, and I love being challenged. This is my way to learn about limits of my endurance and perseverance. Often there are times on the trail when you need to dig a bit deeper into yourself to find the strength to keep on going.
            <br /> In a daily life I often reach into this experience to remind myself that I can, and I will overcome whatever life has thrown at me. <br />
            <p>
            My other passion is traveling; so far this hobby took me to south America, Asia, and Europe. The best part of traveling is the process of discovery; new landscapes, cultures and people and a unique perspective and experiences that can only be obtained when confronted with unknown and unfamiliar. All this is driven by curiosity, and appetite for more, and excitement to learn and expand my horizons. <br />
            <p>

            When I am not hiking or traveling, or expanding my coding skills, you will find me in my backyard in the heart of the busy Williamsburg in Brooklyn, where I grow delicious cucumbers, raspberries, and eggplants. It is my tranquil oasis and the same time never ending work project.

              Tutor for Python programming</p>

               During winter semester I was working as an in-class tutor helping student with Python programming assignments. My role was to check and analyze their code for logical and syntax errors and guide students toward correct solutions and general understanding of the principles of computational thinking. <br />
              It was a great experience, being able to look at other students code and try to understand their logical process. It made me realize that writting a clear and easy to follow code is an art of its own and that commenting your code can one day save you tons of time ;).  </p>
