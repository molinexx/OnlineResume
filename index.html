          <p>I am an Institutional Research Analyst at Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), where I support strategic planning and executive decision-making through advanced analytics, automated reporting, and high-level data presentations. My work spans Python, SQL, Power BI, and Google Apps Script, and increasingly centers on developing efficient, scalable solutions that streamline workflows and improve data accuracy across the institution.</p>
          <p>
            My background in data and programming began at Baruch College, where I transitioned from Finance to Computer Information Systems after discovering my passion for coding and data structures. Since then, I have built strong expertise in data manipulation, visualization, and automation, and I enjoy applying these skills to complex analytical challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            At SEAS, I work independently on a wide range of projects; from enrollment modeling and institutional reporting to dashboard development and long-term trend analysis. I value creativity, autonomy, and clarity in communicating insights, especially in presentations for executive-level audiences. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at Columbia University, with an expected graduation in February 2027, further expanding my training in statistics, machine learning, and research methodology.  

            <br/>
          </p>
            I am a highly analytical and detail-oriented data professional who loves to explore new ways of problem-solving. 
          I believe my skills and experience make me a great fit for any team looking to tackle complex data challenges and drive data-driven decision-making.

            My heart sings when I am outdoors, exploring new trails and immersing myself in nature. 
            Hiking, camping, and biking are my go-to activities that remind me of what is truly important in life and motivate me to be a better version of myself. 
            These experiences have taught me valuable lessons about endurance and perseverance, and I often draw from them in my daily life to overcome any challenges that come my way. <br />
            <p>
            Another one of my passions is traveling, which has taken me to South America, Asia, and Europe so far. 
              The process of discovery is what fuels my love for traveling; from new landscapes and cultures to meeting new people and gaining unique perspectives, there's nothing quite like stepping out of my comfort zone and exploring the unfamiliar. 
              This curiosity and appetite for more fuels my excitement to learn and expand my horizons. <br />
            <p>

            When I'm not adventuring, you can find me tending to my backyard garden in the heart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
              Growing delicious cucumbers, raspberries, and eggplants is both a tranquil escape and an ongoing project that keeps me grounded and connected to the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I believe in finding balance in life and pursuing what brings me joy, whether it's exploring the great outdoors, traveling to new places, or nurturing my garden. 
            These passions keep me energized and motivated, ready to take on any challenge that comes my way.

              The Data Analytics track provided me with a comprehensive understanding of working with big data. 
              This program placed a strong emphasis on Python and its libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as data cleaning, visualization, and extracting data from online sources using API's in JSON format. 
              In addition, I gained expertise in SQL, including creating relational databases in MS Access and running queries in both Access and SQL Developer. 
              This program equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in a data-driven environment and prepared me to solve complex problems using data analysis.
